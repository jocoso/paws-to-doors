<h1 class="about-us">ABOUT US</h1>

<p>  Approximately 6.3 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters every year, with about 3.1 million being dogs and 3.2 million being cats. Sadly, around 920,000 shelter animals are euthanized each year, which includes approximately 530,000 cats and 390,000 dogs. This number has decreased significantly from about 2.6 million in 2011 due to better adoption rates and more effective shelter practices. At Paws to Doors, we believe every pet deserves a loving home. Our mission is to connect adorable paws with caring families, ensuring every cat and dog finds a forever home filled with love and joy. Join us in making a difference, one adoption at a time. Together, we can give these wonderful pets the happy lives they deserve.</p>
